A python script for PTs to run nmap and other tools against in-scope hosts

This script assumes you have feroxbuster installed in the /opt directory via curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/main/install-nix.sh | bash

Installing through apt-get install doesn't seem to work for me on Linodes. It's whatever.
